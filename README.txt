This software creates a .gif file from a complex-variable function. It has been used to visualize the Cayley transform, but the code can be modified to illustrate any other.

Some parameters are taken to draw vertical and horizontal lines (initial Cartesian coordinates) and the image of these lines by the function given is calculated, ploted and returned as a .gif file.
